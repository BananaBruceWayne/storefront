This project is a fully functional ecommerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and complete a purchase. But that's not all - this web app has an added twist. It also incorporates a machine learning model to provide product recommendations to users based on their purchase history and browsing behavior.

To get started with the app, users can create an account and log in. From there, they can browse the various product categories and add items to their cart. The checkout process is straightforward and easy to navigate.

But what sets this ecommerce web app apart is the product recommendation feature. The machine learning model analyzes a user's purchase history and browsing behavior to suggest products they may be interested in. This personalized approach to product recommendations not only enhances the user experience but also increases the likelihood of sales.

The machine learning model was integrated using Python's scikit-learn library, and the data used to train the model was obtained from product attributes, user behavior, and purchasing patterns.

Overall, this ecommerce web app is a great example of how machine learning can be incorporated into a functional application to improve the user experience and drive sales. Thanks for checking out my project!
